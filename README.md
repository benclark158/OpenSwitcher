# OpenSwitcher

This project is going to be to create a software based, open-source network switcher. The software will take NDI, SRT, RTMP, RTMPS and WebRTC. This will allow a multitude of video sources to be input into the mixer. The mixer will also be able to output on all of the above protocols as well as multiview over HDMI.

This is primarily being developed for Windows, however at a later date that might be expanded to Linux systems for additional support/performance.

Camera inputs are expected to be handled by other systems with appropiate capture cards installed.
